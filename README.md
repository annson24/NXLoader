# NXLoader Mod
A modified version of [NXLoader](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/NXLoader). Launch Hekate v4.1 or other Fus√©e Gel√©e payloads from stock Android

Heavily based on [Fus√©e Gel√©e](https://github.com/reswitched/fusee-launcher/) and [ShofEL2](https://github.com/fail0verflow/shofel2). [fusee.bin](https://github.com/ktemkin/Atmosphere/tree/poc_nvidia/fusee) is bundled as a default payload

## Note: Any proprietary payloads are neither tested nor supported by this software.

## Does it work on your device? [Report here](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/NXLoader/issues/1)
## [Get the APK release](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/NXLoader/releases)

This app is currently in "Alpha" state, it's my first Android app and there
is some rather disgusting code (Potentially blocking tasks on the UI thread ü§¢). This will be improved soon‚Ñ¢.

## HOWTO:
- Launch the app.
- (Optional) go to the Config tab, and select a custom payload file.
- Plug in your Switch. (On my Galaxy S8, I use a Type-C to C cable)
- Put it into RCM mode. (Note: your switch will power on by itself when plugged in, be sure to hold VOL+).
- Grant permission to the app to access the USB device.
- Enjoy!

Note: The app does not need to be running in order to launch the payload. The phone can even be locked!

## FAQ:
- Why use this over a web-based launcher?: No internet required, and can auto-launch even if your phone is locked. Plug and play!
- Can it load Linux?: soon‚Ñ¢
- Will it brick my phone/switch?: Hopefully not, but I an certainly not responsible if it does!
- Does it need root?: Nope!

## TODO:
- waiting for the official NXLoader's update

For anyone who wants to look at the exploit source, the magic happens [here](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/NXLoader/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/github/annson24/nxloader/PrimaryLoader.java).
